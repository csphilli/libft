# libft
Repo for the 42 libft project

## About
Our second project in the 42 system, libft is a project for us to create our own library of common C functions. We aren't permitted to just use core functions like memcpy or strncmp unless we have created, validated, and passed our own. This is what this repo is.

## Inclusions
As well as the original functions from the Libft project, there are now also the following included:  
*Get Next Line  
*Ft_Printf
