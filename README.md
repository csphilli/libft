# libft
Repo for the 42 libft project

## About
Our second project in the 42 system, libft is a project for us to create our own library of common C functions. We aren't permitted to just use core functions like memcpy or strncmp unless we have created, validated, and passed our own. This is what this repo is.

## Inclusions
As well as the original functions from the Libft project, there are now also the following included:  
*Get Next Line  
*Ft_Printf  

### Not a perfect score?
This was due to an oversight on my evaluator not checking off one of the boxes during his grading. I didn't catch it until after he submitted it. Fortunately it's not the end of the world in terms of scores. Someday I might revisit the project to get a few more points. Plus, I've done some of the bonuses now that haven't been graded yet.
